# Agent Notes

## Quick Start: New Game Checklist
- **Create content stub** in `content/games/<slug>.md` with the standard front matter (`title`, `layout`, `tip`, optional `theme`). The `layout` key must equal the template filename you add under `layouts/games/<slug>.html`.
- **Copy a reference layout** from `layouts/games/` (Rocket Run, Only Verbs, etc.) and trim it down. Keep every `define` block: `styles`, `body_class`, `main`, `footer`, `scripts`.
- **Use shared shells** in `main`: wrap everything in `.game-shell`, use `.game-card` for surfaces, `.status-banner` for status, `.letter-row` for typing rows, etc. These classes are styled globally in `assets/css/main.css`.
- **Register the game** in `data/games.yaml` (alphabetical list) so navigation, footer carousel, and landing pages stay in sync.
- **Store art and audio** in `static/` (`static/images/...`, etc.) so Hugo copies them automatically. New PNG face art should retain transparent backgrounds.
- **Run Hugo** (`hugo server` for live preview, `hugo` for a one-off build) instead of editing anything in `public/`.

## Building Layouts Consistently
- Scan `assets/css/main.css` for reusable variables before inventing new styles. Many games only override CSS custom properties inside `.game-<slug>`.
- Stick to the shared structure:
  - `.game-shell` wraps each page and controls width/gap.
  - `.game-card` surfaces hold controls, play area, etc.; set per-card overrides with inline `style="--card-shadow-current: …"`.
  - `.status-banner`, `.status-badge`, `.letter-row`, `.letter-box` already have behavior; only tweak colors/sizes via CSS variables.
- For JavaScript, hook up common helpers:
  - `window.GameTouchKeyboard.attach({ … })` for touch devices.
  - `window.GameCelebration.show({ … })` when the player wins.
- Avoid adding global `<script>` or `<style>` tags outside the provided `define` blocks to keep Hugo partials clean.

## Shared Components
### Celebration Overlay
- Partial lives at `layouts/partials/game-win-overlay.html`.
- Trigger with `window.GameCelebration.show({ content, onPlayAgain, focusTarget, initialFocus })`.
- Base template (`layouts/_default/baseof.html`) injects the overlay markup automatically after the `footer`.

### Touch Keyboard & UI Helpers
- `window.GameTouchKeyboard` handles on-screen keys. Pass `getViewportTarget` pointing to the element you want scrolled into view.
- `window.GameUI.fitLettersFor(element)` ensures `.letter-row` boxes resize correctly; call after rendering letters and again inside `requestAnimationFrame`.

## Art & Asset Tips
- Keep character PNGs transparent so gradients show through (`sips -g hasAlpha static/images/*.png` on macOS helps verify).
- Place reusable SVGs or audio in `static/` so Hugo copies them unchanged.
- When adding new gradients or shadows, prefer CSS custom properties inside `.game-<slug>` so other games stay unaffected.
